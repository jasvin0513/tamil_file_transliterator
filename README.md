# Tamil File Transliterator

A simple transliterator script that renames all files within a directory from Tamil characters to their English characters.

The script also truncates file names to 40 characters. This was done to fulfil the script's original purpose of renaming MP3 song names to fit the naming standards of a Honda CRV.

Usage:

```python3 main.py <directory>```
